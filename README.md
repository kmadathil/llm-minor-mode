# llm-minor-mode
Emacs Minor Mode for LLM-boosted text and/or code. 

This will store my LLM-related hacks for working in Emacs. It isn't expected to be completely coherent or usable, but feel free to use, clone, etc. if you find it useful. 

Provides a minor-mode called `llm-minor-mode`
Current functionality:

1. Checks file for instances of "Certainly" after each save, which is a indicator of LLM verbiage accidentally left behind.
